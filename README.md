# Check the Contract

This repository contains a MetaMask Snap that lets you verify that a smart contract has been audited. When you interact with a smart contract, you'll see this information directly in the MetaMask UI. We store it on Arweave.

MetaMask Snaps is a system that allows anyone to safely expand the capabilities of MetaMask. A _snap_ is a program that we run in an isolated environment that can customize the wallet experience.

## Snaps is pre-release software

To interact with (your) Snaps, you will need to install [MetaMask Flask](https://metamask.io/flask/), a canary distribution for developers that provides access to upcoming features.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository and setup the development environment:

```shell
yarn install && yarn start
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in a browser that has MetaMask Flask installed.
